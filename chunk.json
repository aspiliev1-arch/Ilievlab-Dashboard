The discovery could be a breakthrough against antibiotic-resistant infections worldwide.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051122.htm"},{"title":"You don’t have to lose weight to lower your diabetes risk, scientists say","summary":"A major study from Tübingen found that prediabetic individuals who normalized their blood sugar through healthy habits — even without shedding pounds — cut their risk of type 2 diabetes by 71%. Researchers discovered that improved fat distribution, particularly less abdominal fat, was key. The findings suggest that focusing solely on weight loss may overlook the true drivers of diabetes prevention.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051117.htm"},{"title":"Scientists find hidden brain damage behind dementia","summary":"A University of New Mexico scientist is revealing what might be one of the most overlooked causes of dementia — damage in the brain’s tiny blood vessels. Dr. Elaine Bearer has created a new way to classify these changes, showing that many people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s also suffer from vascular damage that quietly destroys brain tissue. Even more surprising, she’s finding microplastics inside the brain that appear linked to inflammation and memory loss.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085637.htm"},{"title":"It’s not just genes — parents can pass down longevity another way","summary":"Scientists studying tiny roundworms have uncovered how the secrets of a long life can be passed from parents to their offspring — without changing DNA. The discovery shows that when certain cellular structures called lysosomes change in ways that promote longevity, those benefits can travel from body cells to reproductive cells. This information is carried by histones, special proteins that help organize DNA, allowing the “memory” of those changes to be inherited.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085628.htm"},{"title":"Why ultra-processed foods aren’t the real villain behind overeating","summary":"Researchers from Leeds found that overeating is driven more by what people believe about food than by its actual ingredients or level of processing. Foods perceived as fatty, sweet, or highly processed were more likely to trigger indulgence. Surprisingly, the “ultra-processed” label explained almost none of the difference in overeating behavior. The findings suggest that perception and psychology may be more important than packaging or processing.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085625.htm"},{"title":"Would you eat yogurt made with ants? Scientists did","summary":"In a remarkable blend of science and tradition, researchers have revived an old Balkan and Turkish yogurt-making technique that uses ants as natural fermenters. The ants’ bacteria, acids, and enzymes transform milk into a rich, tangy yogurt while showcasing the diversity and complexity lost in modern, industrialized yogurt strains.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085623.htm"},{"title":"Nearly half of drivers killed in crashes had THC in their blood","summary":"Over 40% of fatal crash victims had THC levels far above legal limits, showing cannabis use before driving remains widespread. The rate didn’t drop after legalization, suggesting policy changes haven’t altered risky habits. Experts warn that the lack of public awareness around marijuana’s dangers behind the wheel is putting lives at risk.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085621.htm"},{"title":"Brain cancer that eats the skull stuns scientists","summary":"A new study shows glioblastoma isn’t confined to the brain—it erodes the skull and hijacks the immune system within skull marrow. The cancer opens channels that let inflammatory cells enter the brain, fueling its deadly progression. Even drugs meant to protect bones can make things worse, highlighting the need for therapies that target both brain and bone. The discovery reframes glioblastoma as a whole-body disease, not just a brain disorder.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085618.htm"},{"title":"Why the brain’s GPS fails with age, and how some minds defy it","summary":"Stanford scientists found that aging disrupts the brain’s internal navigation system in mice, mirroring spatial memory decline in humans. Older mice struggled to recall familiar locations, while a few “super-agers” retained youthful brain patterns. Genetic clues suggest some animals, and people, may be naturally resistant to cognitive aging. The discovery could pave the way for preventing memory loss in old age.","hyperlink":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085616.htm"},{"title":"Think light drinking protects your brain?
