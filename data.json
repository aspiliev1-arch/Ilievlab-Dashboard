Their research reveals that UV radiation breaks down a protective protein called YTHDF2, which normally prevents a small RNA signal from activating an immune sensor linked to dangerous inflammation. Once that protection is lost, a surprising chain reaction unfolds inside the cell, turning ordinary sun damage into a potential cancer trigger.",
