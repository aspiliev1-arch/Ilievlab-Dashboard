    "summary": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising viral shortcut that turns moving cells into delivery vehicles for infection. Instead of spreading one virus at a time, infected cells bundle viral material into large structures called Migrions and pass them directly to new cells. This collective delivery jump-starts viral replication and boosts disease severity. The finding reveals a migration-based route of viral spread that defies classic models of infection.",

    "summary": "A long-running debate over Tamiflu’s safety in children may finally be settled. Researchers found that influenza, not the antiviral medication, was linked to serious neuropsychiatric events like seizures and hallucinations. Even more striking, kids treated with Tamiflu had about half the risk of these events compared to untreated children with the flu. The results suggest the drug may be protective rather than harmful.",
