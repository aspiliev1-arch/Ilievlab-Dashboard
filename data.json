    "title": "Scientists uncover the brain’s hidden learning blocks",
    "summary": "Princeton researchers found that the brain excels at learning because it reuses modular “cognitive blocks” across many tasks. Monkeys switching between visual categorization challenges revealed that the prefrontal cortex assembles these blocks like Legos to create new behaviors. This flexibility explains why humans learn quickly while AI models often forget old skills. The insights may help build better AI and new clinical treatments for impaired cognitive adaptability.",

The researchers emphasize that outdoor activity shouldn’t stop, but better air quality could unlock far greater health gains.",
