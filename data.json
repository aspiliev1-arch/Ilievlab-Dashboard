These phases are separated by sudden turning points that mark big shifts in how the brain is organized. The most surprising discovery is that adolescent-style development lasts into our early thirties. The work helps explain changing abilities and risks at different points in life.",

    "title": "Your skin has a built-in cancer defense and sunlight turns it off",
    "summary": "Scientists have uncovered how too much sunlight can flip a hidden switch inside skin cells that makes inflammation spiral out of control and increases the risk of cancer. Their research reveals that UV radiation breaks down a protective protein called YTHDF2, which normally prevents a small RNA signal from activating an immune sensor linked to dangerous inflammation. Once that protection is lost, a surprising chain reaction unfolds inside the cell, turning ordinary sun damage into a potential cancer trigger.",
